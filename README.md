# Minimoog Model D Emulation with Python and Pyo

## Overview
This project is a digital emulation of the iconic Minimoog Model D synthesizer, implemented in Python using the Pyo library. The Minimoog Model D is renowned for its analog warmth and classic sound, and this emulation aims to replicate its functionality and sonic characteristics in a digital environment.

## Features
- **Oscillators**: Emulates the three classic oscillators of the Minimoog (sawtooth, square, triangle) and more(Pulse, Bipolar pulse, Sample and hold, Modulated Sine) 
- **Filters**: Includes a resonant low-pass filter with cutoff and resonance controls.
- **Envelopes**: ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelopes for amplitude and filter modulation.
- **LFO**: Low-frequency oscillator for modulation and filter control.
- **Routing**: Simplified modulation routing for easy tweaking.
- **Spatial Effects**: Added spatial effects for enhanced soundscapes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pyo library
